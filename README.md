# Simulation

this app is part of a student project taking place from Nov 2020 to Feb 2021. 
If you are looking for a user guide, use the UI hints after starting this app or read the documentation provided to the grading committee. This repository will not provide any further documentation.

## Starting this app

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To use this app, you will also need to install the appropriate backend, which is currently not open source. Doing so will allow this project to send and receive data to and from `http://localhost:8080/simulation`.
